# One version number, in four files (T-701, T-703).
#
# The updater compares the version in the running bundle against the version in
# the release manifest. If `tauri.conf.json` says 0.1.0 while the tag says
# v0.2.0, the release ships as 0.1.0 and every installed copy decides it is
# already up to date — a silent no-op that looks exactly like success. This is
# the check that stops that, and the release workflow runs it before it builds
# anything.
#
# The fourth file is the root `Cargo.toml`, which is the server's version: a
# tag also publishes `ghcr.io/matthewguenther/linger:<tag>`, and that image's
# `GET /health` reports whatever this number says. A host reading it to find
# out what they are running deserves an answer that is true.
#
# Usage: scripts/version-check.sh [tag]
#   With a tag (v0.2.0 or 0.2.0), the tag has to agree with the files too.
