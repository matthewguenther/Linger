# The Tauri updater signing key (T-701; ARCHITECTURE §7, baseline 8).
#
# Every update Linger installs is verified against one minisign public key that
# is compiled into the app. Whoever holds the matching private key can ship an
# update to every machine running Linger, and nobody else can. Two consequences,
# both permanent:
#
#   * Lose the private key and you can never ship an update again. Not to your
#     own machines, not to anyone's. The only way out is to hand-install a new
#     build carrying a new public key, on every computer.
#   * Leak the private key and whoever has it can push code to every machine
#     running Linger.
#
# So: it is generated once, on a machine you trust, with a password, and backed
# up offline before anything ships. This script does the generating part and
# tells you the rest. It never writes the private key inside the repo.
#
# Usage: scripts/updater-key.sh
#   LINGER_UPDATER_KEY=/path/to/updater.key scripts/updater-key.sh
#
# Running it again when a key already exists prints the public key and the
# checklist again. It will not overwrite an existing key — that is the one
# mistake this script exists to make impossible.

Before anything ships, all four of these:

  1. Back up $key somewhere offline. A password manager
     attachment, a printed copy in a drawer, an encrypted USB stick in a
     different building. Not a cloud drive that syncs from this machine, and
     not only this machine.
  2. Back up the password the same way, separately.
  3. Add two repository secrets on GitHub
     (Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions):
       TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY           the contents of $key
       TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD  the password you just chose
  4. Commit the public key in $conf.

The private key never goes in git, never goes in a chat message, and never
leaves this machine except into the backup and the GitHub secret.
