# Does the release signing key actually work, and is it the right one? (T-701)
#
# Two secrets have to be correct before a tag can ship anything:
#
#   TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY           the contents of the key file
#   TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_PASSWORD  its password
#
# "Correct" is not "present". A key that signs fine but is not the mate of the
# public key compiled into the app produces a release that builds green, uploads
# cleanly, and that no installed copy will accept — every one of them rejects the
# bundle as unsigned. That failure looks exactly like success right up until
# somebody tries to update, which is the worst time to find out.
#
# So this signs a throwaway file for real and checks that the key id in the
# signature matches the key id in `tauri.conf.json`. It is fast, it runs before
# anything is built, and it needs no bundle.
#
# Usage: scripts/signing-preflight.sh [path/to/tauri.conf.json]
