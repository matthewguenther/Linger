linger-server — one binary, one data directory.

  linger-server
      Serve. Configured by the LINGER_* environment variables.

  linger-server reset-password <username>
      Set a new password for that account, and print it.

  linger-server reset-password <username> --stdin
      Same, but read the new password from stdin instead of making one up.

Stop the server before resetting a password — one SQLite file has one writer:

  docker compose stop linger
  docker compose run --rm linger reset-password <username>
  docker compose start linger
