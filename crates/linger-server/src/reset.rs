//! `reset-password`: the way back into a server whose host is locked out (T-414).
//!
//! There is no reset email and no reset link, on purpose. A Linger server holds
//! no addresses to send one to, and the first-run setup token only exists while
//! the server has no users at all — so once the host has forgotten their
//! password there is nothing left that can prove who they are except the machine
//! itself. Being able to run a command against the database *is* the proof of
//! ownership, which is the position ARCHITECTURE §9 already takes on first-run
//! setup: no token, no login, no credentials in environment variables.
//!
//! The password never arrives as a command-line argument. Arguments land in
//! shell history and are readable in `ps` by anyone else on the box, so the
//! caller either lets [`generate_password`] make one or pipes one in.
