//! The file sweeper: what SPEC §4.10 means by "files expire after 365 days".
//!
//! A shared server fills up. Left alone it fills up forever, because nobody
//! goes back and tidies a year of screenshots, and the day it is full is the
//! day somebody cannot share the thing they wanted to share. So files age out —
//! and the two ways to say "keep this" are the two the product already has: a
//! star on the file, or a pin on the message carrying it (SPEC §4.4).
//!
//! Three kinds of object get taken, and only the first is about age:
//!
//! 1. **Old files** — complete, unstarred, not on a pinned message, older than
//!    `LINGER_FILE_EXPIRY_DAYS`. This is the rule in the spec.
//! 2. **Files on deleted messages** — a deleted message is a tombstone with an
//!    empty body (`routes::messages::delete`), and neither the stream nor the
//!    media collection will ever draw what it was carrying again. The bytes are
//!    unreachable and still counted against the pool, so they go at once rather
//!    than in a year. A star does not save one of these: a star means "do not
//!    let this age out", and somebody deleting the message is not age.
//! 3. **Finished uploads that never became a message** — somebody picked a file
//!    and then closed the composer. `routes::uploads` sweeps *unfinished* ones
//!    after 48 hours; a finished orphan has nothing to wait for either, but it
//!    is given the full expiry window in case a client is holding the id while
//!    a person types.
//!
//! A status image is never taken, whatever its age. It is not on a message, so
//! rule 3 would otherwise claim it, and a status quietly losing its picture
//! after a year is not something a person would connect to a file expiry they
//! never set (T-506).
//!
//! Deleting is bytes first, row second. The other order can lose an object with
//! nothing left pointing at it — a file nobody can see and nobody can remove.
//! Doing it this way, a crash in between leaves a row whose bytes are gone,
//! which the next pass tries again and finishes.
