//! DMs (SPEC §4.13, PROTOCOL §3.1, T-1301).
//!
//! Two endpoints, and almost all of the file is the check on the way in.
//!
//! A DM is a room, so there is no `GET /dms/:id/messages` and no DM anything
//! else: once it exists it is addressed by `room_id` like any room, and the
//! membership check lives in `repo::rooms::visible_to`, which every room-scoped
//! route already goes through.
