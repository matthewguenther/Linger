//! Knock (SPEC §4.9, PROTOCOL §7, T-1101).
//!
//! One endpoint, and most of it is what it refuses to do. A knock is a nudge at
//! one person that does not ask for a reply: no body, no thread, no unread
//! state, nothing to dismiss. **Nothing is written down.** There is no knocks
//! table and there must never be one — a knock somebody can go back and read is
//! a message, and a message is the thing this feature exists to avoid making
//! anybody compose.
//!
//! So the whole of it is: check the person is really here, check the rate
//! limit, put one frame on that person's sessions. If they are not connected,
//! the knock lands nowhere and that is the correct behaviour — it is a tap on
//! the shoulder, not a voicemail.
