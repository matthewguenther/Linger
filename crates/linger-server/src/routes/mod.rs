//! Route assembly. Everything REST lives under `/api/v1`; the gateway upgrades
//! at `/api/v1/gateway` (PROTOCOL preamble).
//!
//! Two paths sit deliberately *outside* `/api/v1`: `/upload/...` takes the bytes
//! of an upload and `/objects/...` serves them back. Bytes never travel through
//! the JSON API (ARCHITECTURE §8) — see [`objects`].
//!
//! `/objects/...` is also outside the app's *origin*, not just its path space:
//! it answers on `cdn.<domain>` and nowhere else, and every other route answers
//! everywhere else. See [`media_origin_gate`].
//!
//! Still to mount: `/media` (T-504), `/export` (M8).
//!
//! Unknown paths get the PROTOCOL §1 envelope, not axum's plain-text 404, so
//! the client can always switch on `error.code`.
