//! The upload pipeline's paperwork (PROTOCOL §6, ARCHITECTURE §8).
//!
//! Three calls and no bytes. The client asks for a slot, PUTs the file straight
//! at the URL it gets back (see [`crate::routes::objects`]), and then says it is
//! finished. Only at that last step does the server look at what actually
//! arrived — and everything the client claimed on the way in gets checked again
//! against the bytes on disk, because a declared size and a declared type are
//! both just strings somebody sent.
//!
//! Completing can fail in two different ways, and they are not the same thing.
//! If parts are missing the upload is still alive: send them and ask again.
//! If what arrived is not an acceptable file, the slot is finished — resending
//! the same bytes into the same declaration cannot make them acceptable.
//!
//! The upload and the attachment it will become share one id. There is nothing
//! to remember about an upload that the attachment row does not already hold,
//! and the part layout is a pure function of the size (`storage::part_plan`), so
//! a resumed upload works out the identical plan without asking.
