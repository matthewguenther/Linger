//! `POST /links/preview` — the one-line card a link renders as (SPEC §5.6).
//!
//! The client asks about the URLs it is drawing; the server answers from its
//! cache and fetches whatever is missing or stale. **The client never fetches**:
//! if it did, every site anybody linked would collect the IP of every person who
//! scrolled past the message, and a favicon `<img>` pointed at a remote host
//! would do it without anyone clicking a thing. So the host's own IP does the
//! looking, once per URL for everybody, and the icon comes back inline as a
//! `data:` URI (`links::fetch`, where the SSRF guard lives).
//!
//! A URL this server will not fetch — a private address, a port, anything that
//! is not http(s) — still gets a card, made of its domain. Refusing to answer
//! would tell the client to try again forever, and a link to `192.168.1.1` in a
//! message is far more likely to be somebody's router than an attack.
