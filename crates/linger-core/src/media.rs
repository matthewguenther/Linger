//! What a server accepts as an upload, and how it is allowed to serve it back
//! (PROTOCOL §6, ARCHITECTURE §7/§8).
//!
//! This is a closed vocabulary like [`crate::PALETTE`] and [`crate::FONTS`]: the
//! server validates every declared MIME type against it at slot creation, and
//! again against the *sniffed* type at complete. Two rules shape the lists.
//!
//! First, active content never gets in. `image/svg+xml`, `text/html` and their
//! relatives are scripts wearing a file extension, and the only reliable defence
//! is not to store them at all (ARCHITECTURE §7 "user content is hostile").
//!
//! Second, only the image/video/audio types below are ever served inline. Every
//! other type is handed to the browser as a download with `nosniff`, so a file
//! this list does not recognise cannot become a page.

/// Image types the server takes. Every one of these is re-encoded on upload,
/// which strips EXIF (SPEC §4.10) and neutralises polyglots in the same step.
