//! linger-core is the contract.
//!
//! Every type that crosses the client/server boundary is defined here and exported
//! to TypeScript via `ts-rs` (`cargo test -p linger-core` regenerates
//! `client/src/generated/`). The frontend never hand-writes a wire type.
//!
//! This crate also owns the closed vocabularies the server validates against:
//! the 16-color name palette, the curated font set, and the fixed reaction set.
