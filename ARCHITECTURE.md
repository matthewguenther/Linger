# Linger — Architecture

Companion to `SPEC.md`. Wire protocol is in `PROTOCOL.md`. Agent working rules are in
`AGENTS.md`.

## 2. Stack decisions and why

| Choice | Reason | When to revisit |
|---|---|---|
| **Rust server (axum + tokio)** | A single static binary is a dramatically better self-host story than "install Node, install pnpm, run migrations." Also lets client and server share types. | Never for V1. |
| **SQLite (WAL), not Postgres** | 20 friends, a few hundred messages a day. Postgres is ceremony at this scale. One file to back up. | Only if a server exceeds ~2k users or needs multi-node. A `Repository` trait keeps the swap cheap. |
| **Tauri 2, not Electron** | ~5–15 MB bundle vs ~150 MB; ~100 MB idle RAM vs ~400 MB; first-class Rust, which is where the gateway, the keyring and (in V2) audio live. | Only if WebKitGTK rendering on Linux becomes untenable. |
| **TypeScript + React frontend** | Largest ecosystem for virtualized lists and rich text; fastest to iterate. | — |
| **Object store adapter, not blobs in DB** | 500 MB files must never traverse the app server. | — |

### The Tauri caveat, stated up front

Tauri uses the OS WebView: WebView2 on Windows, WKWebView on macOS, **WebKitGTK on
Linux**. WebKitGTK is the weak link — it lags on newer CSS and has historically been
rough with WebRTC.

Consequences:
1. **Test on Linux first, every milestone.** If it works on WebKitGTK it works
   everywhere. The reverse is not true.
2. **Keep V2 audio in Rust, not in the WebView.** Use a Rust WebRTC stack (`webrtc-rs`)
   with `cpal` for device I/O. This is the better architecture anyway and it removes
   WebKitGTK from the critical path for voice.
3. Avoid CSS features newer than ~2023 without checking WebKitGTK support. `oklch()` is
   supported and is required by §4.5 of the spec; verify it in the target WebKitGTK
   version during M0.

```

`linger-core` is the contract. Types defined there are exported to TypeScript via `ts-rs`
during build. **The frontend never hand-writes a type that crosses the wire.**

---

## 4. Identifiers

**UUIDv7**, stored in SQLite as `BLOB(16)`, rendered on the wire as lowercase hex.

- Time-sortable, so `ORDER BY id` is chronological and pagination is a simple range scan
- No coordination needed, unlike Snowflake
- 16 bytes indexed, not 36 bytes of text

Do not use auto-increment integers (leaks volume, breaks any future merge) and do not
use UUIDv4 (destroys index locality).

**Presence is never persisted.** It lives in an in-memory `DashMap<UserId, Presence>` in
the gateway. On restart everyone is offline until they reconnect. This is correct: stale
persisted presence is worse than none.

---

## 6. Presence

Where somebody is: `in_room`, `around`, `idle` (no input for 10 minutes), `away`
(explicit, with a message), `offline`. It lives in the gateway
(`crates/linger-server/src/gateway/`), it is held in memory, and it is not stored.

**This section used to be "Activity detection — the hard part"** and it described a
`linger-activity` crate with a per-OS backend for KWin, X11, Windows and macOS, a
bundled registry of ~200 applications, a poller with a 20-second debounce, and five
privacy controls to make it safe. All of it is cut (Matt, 2026-08-28 —
`docs/decisions.md`). The crate is deleted, the registry is deleted, the wire field
is deleted, and SPEC §4.3 says what replaced it: a status somebody typed.

It is worth knowing why it was the hard part, because the reason is still true of
anything that reaches into the desktop: Wayland deliberately has no equivalent of
X11's `_NET_ACTIVE_WINDOW`, so there is no cross-compositor way to ask what window
is in front. Every implementation is per-compositor, and KDE, GNOME, Hyprland and
sway each need different code. If a future feature wants that kind of access, that
is the wall it hits, and the answer is very likely still "ask the person instead".

**No window titles.** Nothing in this codebase reads one, and no type has a field
that could carry one. That was a hard rule when there was code that could have
broken it, and it stays a hard rule now that there is not.

---

## 7. Security

### Threat model, stated plainly — publish this verbatim in the README

> Messages and files are encrypted in transit (TLS) and at rest on the host's disk.
> **The person running the server can read everything on it.** There is no
> end-to-end encryption. Run your own server, or trust the person who runs the one
> you're on. If you need cryptographic guarantees against your host, use Signal.

**Do not implement partial E2EE.** Real E2EE with multi-device, searchable history, and
file sharing means MLS (RFC 9420) plus device verification, key transparency, and backup
escrow — a larger project than everything else in this repo combined. Half-implemented
E2EE launders a false promise, which is worse than an honest limitation.

### Baseline requirements

1. **Passwords:** argon2id, `m=19456, t=2, p=1` minimum. Never SHA/bcrypt.
2. **Tokens:** access JWT, 15 min TTL, `EdDSA`. Refresh token, 30 days, rotating, stored
   hashed. Reuse of a rotated refresh token revokes the whole family.
3. **Client token storage:** OS keyring via `tauri-plugin-stronghold` or the `keyring`
   crate. **Test the headless / no-wallet fallback path explicitly** — a Linux box with
   no KWallet or gnome-keyring unlocked must degrade to a clear prompt, not a crash.
4. **No open registration.** Invite code required, always. Codes are 12 chars from a
   CSPRNG, single-use by default.
5. **Rate limits:** login 5/min/IP, message send 10/10s/user, upload slot 20/hour/user,
   invite creation 10/day/user, knock 3/hour/target, search 30/min/user.
6. **CORS is an allowlist, not a wildcard.** The client is a webview page, so it is
   a cross-origin caller and the server must grant it permission explicitly. The
   allowed origins are the Tauri app's (`tauri://localhost`, and
   `http(s)://tauri.localhost` on Windows) plus Vite's dev server. Reflecting any
   origin would let a website you happened to visit probe whether this server
   exists, which is worth avoiding for a product that is otherwise this private.
7. **Tauri capabilities:** the WebView gets the minimum permission set. Every
   native capability it has is one narrow command in `client/src-tauri/src/`, and
   it has no others — not the updater plugin's own commands, not the keyring, not
   the socket.
8. **Signed auto-updates.** Tauri's updater, with one minisign key whose public half
   is committed in `client/src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` and whose private half is
   **generated once by `scripts/updater-key.sh` and backed up offline** (T-701).
   Losing it means you can never ship an update; leaking it means whoever has it
   can ship code to every machine running Linger. Verification is not optional and
   has no bypass: a build with no key configured refuses every update rather than
   installing an unverified one. The WebView is granted none of the updater
   plugin's permissions — it calls two of the app's own commands
   (`client/src-tauri/src/updates.rs`), so a page can never start an installer.
9. **No telemetry.** Not opt-in, not anonymous, not crash reporting. None.

### User content is hostile

- **Serve uploads from a separate origin** (`cdn.linger.example`, not
  `linger.example/files`). Uploaded SVG and HTML are XSS vectors, and same-origin serving
  makes them session-stealing vectors.
- Force `Content-Disposition: attachment` and `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` on
  anything not on the image/video/audio allowlist.
- Re-encode images server-side. This strips EXIF (spec §4.10) and neutralizes polyglot
  files in one step.
- Strict CSP on the app origin: no remote script, no remote fonts, and nothing
  reachable except the server the app is signed in to. `unsafe-inline` survives on
  `style-src` alone and cannot be removed: the message list is virtualized, so a row's
  position is a style attribute, and a person's name is painted from `--person-*`
  properties set the same way. `script-src` is `'self'` and nothing else.
- **The policy comes in two, and the shipped one is the strict one.**
  `tauri.conf.json` carries `csp` and `devCsp`; Tauri picks between them at compile
  time, so `pnpm tauri dev` gets the local-server relaxations
  (`http://localhost:*`, `http://127.0.0.1:*`) and anything the bundler produces
  does not. A shipped page that could reach `http://localhost:*` could knock on
  every other service the person is running. Two sources in both policies look like
  relaxations and are not: `ipc:` and `http://ipc.localhost` are Tauri's own IPC
  channel — `invoke()` is a `fetch` at one of them — and blocking them does not stop
  IPC, it drops it silently onto a slower `postMessage` fallback.
  `client/src-tauri/tests/csp.rs` holds both policies to this.
- Markdown rendering: allowlist-based sanitizer, no raw HTML passthrough, ever.

**The origin split is enforced, not just advertised.** `LINGER_MEDIA_DOMAIN` defaults to
`cdn.<LINGER_DOMAIN>`, and the server refuses to start if it is the same host as the app.
Both names reach the same process through the reverse proxy, so a `Host` check decides
what each one serves: on the media host, `/objects/...` and nothing else; on every other
name, everything *but* `/objects/...`. A file that talked a browser into running it would
find no API at its own origin, and an upload cannot be fetched from the app's own name at
all. A server with no `LINGER_DOMAIN` has one origin and no split — honest for a box on a
LAN, and what every test server runs as. **It is also unreachable from an installed
client**, whose CSP allows `https` and nothing else, so that mode belongs to
development and to tests rather than to anybody's friends. The server says so at
startup: no domain gets a warning, and the first-run setup link says the address
cannot be reached by an installed app. It warns rather than refusing, because a bare
bind address is what `cargo test` and `pnpm tauri dev` both run against.

Every served object also carries `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'none'; sandbox`
and `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: cross-origin`, and the `Content-Type` is never the
uploader's claim: it is one of the thirteen media types the server sniffed for itself, or
`application/octet-stream`.

**On S3, the bytes come from the bucket**, and S3 has no `response-` override for
`X-Content-Type-Options` or `Content-Security-Policy` — only for the content type and the
disposition, both of which are signed into every presigned URL. Proxying the bytes back
through this process to add the other two would break the rule the S3 backend exists to
keep (§8). What stands in for them:

1. Active content is not storable. `image/svg+xml`, `text/html` and every script type are
   off the allowlist in `linger-core::media`, checked against the declared type at slot
   creation and against the *sniffed* type at complete.
2. Everything off the inline list is `application/octet-stream` with
   `Content-Disposition: attachment`, which a browser downloads rather than renders
   whatever it decides the bytes are.
3. Those two headers are stored **on the object** as well as signed into the URL, so a
   bucket behind a CDN, or one somebody made public, still hands the file over as a
   download.

A host who wants the literal header on the S3 path adds a response-header rule at
whatever CDN fronts the bucket (an R2 transform rule, a CloudFront response-headers
policy). It is defence in depth on top of the three above, not the thing holding the
door.

**Link previews are a server-side request forgery machine** if written carelessly, and
this server sits on a home LAN next to a router admin page. `links.rs` fetches them, and
the rules are: `http(s)` on default ports only; the hostname is resolved by the server and
the whole name refused if **any** address it answers with is private, loopback,
link-local (which is where cloud metadata services live), CGNAT or reserved; the
connection is then pinned to the address that was checked, so the name cannot resolve to
something else in between; redirects are followed by hand, three at most, every hop
re-checked; time and bytes are both capped and the body is read in chunks. Nothing the
response says is trusted either — the HTML is scanned for a title and an icon href by a
small tag reader and never rendered, and an icon is kept only if its *bytes* sniff as a
raster image. SVG is refused wherever it appears, exactly as it is on the upload
allowlist.

The fetch is host-side for a privacy reason before a caching one: if each client fetched
its own preview, every site anybody linked would collect the IP of every person who
scrolled past the message, and a remote favicon would do it without a click. The host's
IP does it once for everybody, and the icon reaches the client as a small `data:` URI.

---

## 8. File pipeline

Never proxy bytes through the app server.

```
1. Client  → POST /uploads          { filename, size, mime }
2. Server  → validates quota, creates attachment(state=pending),
             returns { upload_id, url, method, headers, part_size }
3. Client  → PUT direct to object store (multipart if > 8 MB, resumable)
4. Client  → POST /uploads/{id}/complete
5. Server  → verifies size, sniffs real MIME, re-encodes image (strips EXIF),
             generates blurhash + poster frame, sets state=complete
6. Server  → attaches to message, fans out over gateway
```

**Storage backends:**
- `local` — filesystem under the data dir. Default. Correct for a home server.
- `s3` — any S3-compatible endpoint.

Both sit behind one `ObjectStore` trait (`crates/linger-server/src/storage/`). It has
four jobs: hand out a slot, gather an upload's parts into one local file the server can
inspect, store/read/delete a finished object, and throw away the parts of an upload that
died. Everything that decides *whether* bytes are acceptable is in `media`, not storage.

**The S3 backend does not use S3's own multipart upload.** Each part is presigned to its
own key, `uploads/{upload_id}/{part}`, and `assemble` streams those down into one local
file. S3 multipart would assemble the object inside the bucket, and the server's next
move is to download it anyway — sniffing the real type and re-encoding an image both need
the bytes on local disk — so the file would cross the wire three times. It would also
introduce an upload id of S3's own, handed out by a network call, which is exactly the
per-upload state this design does not want to store. The finished object goes up as one
PUT; files are capped at 500 MB, well under S3's 5 GB single-PUT limit.

Serving from S3 is a redirect to a presigned GET, so bytes never cross the app process on
the way out either. The `Content-Type` and `Content-Disposition` that force a download for
anything off the inline allowlist are signed into that URL as `response-*` overrides,
because the app server is not the thing sending the response any more.

For cloud hosting, recommend **Cloudflare R2**: zero egress fees, which matters
enormously for a file-sharing app. Backblaze B2 is the runner-up. Plain AWS S3 will bite
you on egress.

**The local backend's listener.** Step 3 is trivial with S3 — the client PUTs at Amazon.
With a filesystem there is no second machine, so the local backend hands out URLs under
`PUT /upload/{upload_id}/{part}` on the app host, and objects come back from
`GET /objects/{key}` on the media host and only there (§7).
Neither path is under `/api/v1`, neither reads an `Authorization` header, and neither
touches a session: the part URL is signed with an HMAC over the upload id, the part
number and an expiry, which is what an S3 presigned URL is. The signing key lives in the
data dir beside the JWT key, because it has to survive a restart or a resumed upload
would find every URL it was holding invalid — the exact case resumability exists for.

An upload id **is** an attachment id. The part layout is a pure function of the declared
size, so nothing about an in-flight upload needs its own table.

**Failing at step 5 is two different things.** Parts missing is the ordinary shape of a
dropped connection: the slot stays pending and the client sends what is missing. Anything
else — wrong size, a file that is not the type it claimed, an image that will not decode
— is final, and the parts go.

**ffmpeg is optional.** `ffprobe` supplies video and audio duration and video dimensions;
`ffmpeg` grabs the poster frame. A server without them stores media perfectly well and
simply has no poster. The published image installs them.

**The sweeper** (`expiry.rs`) is the server's one background task — spawned by `main`,
not by `AppState`, so building the state in a test never starts a loop nobody asked for.
It runs at startup and every six hours, in batches, and takes three kinds of object:

- files past `LINGER_FILE_EXPIRY_DAYS` (default 365) that are neither starred nor on a
  pinned message — the rule in SPEC §4.10. `LINGER_FILE_EXPIRY_DAYS=off` turns it off.
- files on a **deleted** message, at once. A delete is a tombstone with an empty body,
  and neither the stream nor the media collection will ever draw what it carried again,
  so the bytes are unreachable and still counted against the pool. A star does not hold
  one of these: a star stops a file ageing out, and this is not ageing out.
- **finished uploads that never became a message**, once they are past the same window.
  The 48-hour sweep in `routes::uploads` only takes uploads that never *completed*.

A status image is never taken, at any age: it is not on a message, so the third rule
would otherwise claim it. Deletion is bytes first, row second — the other order can lose
an object with nothing left pointing at it, and a crash between the two leaves a row the
next pass finishes.

**The pool and the expiry window are environment variables** (`LINGER_POOL_BYTES`,
`LINGER_FILE_EXPIRY_DAYS`), read once at startup like every other deployment setting, not
rows a host edits from inside the app (`docs/decisions.md`). `GET /server` reports the
used figure, the ceiling and the window, and the status bar draws the first two.

## 9. Deployment

Target: a non-expert friend gets a working server in under 15 minutes.

```yaml
# deploy/compose.yaml
services:
  linger:
    image: ghcr.io/OWNER/linger:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes: [ "./data:/data" ]
    environment:
      LINGER_DOMAIN: linger.example.com
      LINGER_DATA_DIR: /data
      LINGER_STORAGE: local
      # uploads are served from cdn.<LINGER_DOMAIN>; override with
      # LINGER_MEDIA_DOMAIN
  caddy:
    image: caddy:2
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports: [ "80:80", "443:443" ]
    volumes:
      - ./Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile
      - caddy_data:/data
volumes: { caddy_data: {} }
```

Caddy is bundled specifically so TLS certificates are automatic. A self-hoster should
never have to think about certbot. Its Caddyfile has two blocks and the deployment needs
two DNS records: the domain, and `cdn.` in front of it for uploaded files (§7).

**First-run flow:** binary starts, finds no config, prints a one-time host-setup URL with
a token to stdout. Host opens it, creates their account, names the server. No env-var
bootstrap credentials.

**Backup:** the entire server is `data/linger.db` plus `data/objects/`. Document
`sqlite3 linger.db ".backup"` and a cron one-liner in the README. Do not build a backup
feature.

**Locked out:** no reset email, no reset link — the setup token only exists while the
server has no users, so the only remaining proof of ownership is access to the box.
`linger-server reset-password <username>` sets a new password and revokes that user's
refresh families. The password is generated and printed, or read from stdin; never
taken from argv, which leaks into shell history and `ps`. Stop the server first — one
SQLite file has one writer.

## 10. Build milestones

Each milestone is independently verifiable. Do not start the next until the current one
passes its check.

| # | Milestone | Done when | Estimate |
|---|---|---|---|
| **M0** | Workspace scaffold, CI, `ts-rs` type export, Tauri shell opens on all 3 OSes | `cargo test` and `pnpm build` green in CI; blank window opens on Linux/Win/macOS | 1 day |
| **M1** | Server: auth, invites, rooms, messages | Integration test suite drives the full REST surface with `reqwest`. No UI yet. | 2–3 days |
| **M2** | Gateway: WS, heartbeat, sequence numbers, resume | Test client survives a forced disconnect mid-stream and replays without gaps or duplicates | 2 days |
| **M3** | Client: message list, composer, session grouping, aging, density modes | Two clients on one machine exchange messages in real time | 4–5 days |
| **M4** | Presence + roster + in-room state + statuses | Roster updates live across two clients; a status set on one shows up on the other | 2 days |
| **M4.5** | Host controls (rooms, invites, server settings), member settings, the server list | A host who has only seen the app can create a server, add a room, invite a friend, and rename the server — no curl, no docs | 2–3 days |
| **M5** | Uploads, media pipeline, the media collection, status images | 400 MB video uploads, resumes after a killed connection, appears in the media grid | 3 days |
| **M6** | Styling: names, statuses, 16-color palette, themes, fonts | A user sets a gradient name from two palette keys; contrast is verifiably ≥4.5:1 in both themes | 2–3 days |
| **M7** | Packaging: installers, signing, notarization, auto-update | A signed installer for each OS, and an update ships end-to-end | 3–5 days |
| **M8** | Export | One archive contains every message and file, and it opens | 1 day |

**V2 starts here.** Planned 2026-08-28. **M9, M10 and M11 are built**
(2026-08-29 and 2026-08-31), and **M12's signalling landed 2026-09-01**; the
audio path and ambient voice are not started. The order below is not SPEC §6's listing order: knock and search
are small and self-contained, and voice is the largest and riskiest thing in the
project. V1's remaining work is still five things a person has to do by hand
(`TASKS.md`, *Human checks*), and M9's check is a sixth.

| # | Milestone | Done when | Estimate |
|---|---|---|---|
| **M9** | Knock (SPEC §4.9) | A knock crosses two machines, fades on its own, and leaves nothing behind | 1–2 days — **built 2026-08-29; the two-machine half of the check is HC-6** |
| **M10** | Search | Type a word, get the messages containing it, click one, land on it in its room | 3–4 days — **built: index and endpoint 2026-08-30, surface 2026-08-31. Its check passed in a running app** |
| **M11** | DMs and group DMs | Two people hold a conversation no other member can see in *any* surface — stream, media, search, export, notifications | 4–6 days — **built 2026-08-31.** Its check passed surface by surface against a running server; the two-machine half is a human check |
| **M12** | Voice rooms | Four people, four networks, one hour, no drops | 1–2 weeks — **signalling landed 2026-09-01 (T-1401): the frames, no audio.** Everything from T-1402 needs real networks |
| **M13** | Ambient voice | A room left running all day costs almost no CPU, and nobody joined anything | 3–5 days |
| **M14** | Custom themes | Somebody makes a colour scheme, it survives a restart, and a file carries it to another computer | **V3, not V2.** Three decisions come first — see `TASKS.md` *Parking lot* |

**A mobile client is not in this sequence** (Matt, 2026-08-28). It was going to
be M14; it is on `TASKS.md`'s *Backburner* instead, because the desktop app has
to be finished and used by real people before a second platform doubles the
surface of every bug still in it. **M14 is now custom themes** (Matt,
2026-08-31), which is V3 rather than V2: SPEC §6 carries the scope line and
`TASKS.md` M14 carries the three things that have to be decided before any of it
starts. The short version is that a theme is a list of token values rather than
a stylesheet, §5.1's visual rules are not themeable, and if a theme can repaint
the 16 name colours then the 4.5:1 contrast test has to move out of CI and into
the app.

Where search lives in the layout was Matt's and was answered on 2026-08-30 —
a destination in the rail next to `media`, covering what people typed and the
names of files (SPEC §4.12). **Landing on a hit changed how the client holds
history** (T-1203, [`docs/tasks/m10.md`](docs/tasks/m10.md)): a message six
months back is thousands of pages behind the newest, so the messages endpoint
grew `around=<id>` and a room can now be *behind its own newest message*. While
it is, live message frames for that room are dropped rather than folded into
history they do not join onto — an invisible gap is the one thing the message
store must never produce. One decision is still open and blocks the work it
belongs to: whether mobile push through Apple and Google is acceptable at all
(whenever mobile comes back). It is in `TASKS.md`'s parking lot.

**The activity-detection spike came before M0** and did its job. One evening,
Kubuntu/Plasma 6 Wayland and Windows, a throwaway binary that printed the
foreground app every second. It was retired on 2026-08-19 having answered the
question it was for. The feature it was a spike for was cut on 2026-08-28
(`docs/decisions.md`); the spike was still worth the evening, because finding
out early what a thing costs is how you get to decide whether to build it.

**Entrance sounds moved to the end of the queue** (Matt, 2026-08-21). They are still
V1 (SPEC §6, item 4) — they are simply the last thing built, after M8, and M4's check
no longer waits on them. `TASKS.md` holds them under *Backburner* as T-901…T-903
(they were T-403, T-404, T-408).

**Activity detection is cut** (Matt, 2026-08-28 — `docs/decisions.md`). Parked on
2026-08-23, deleted five days later: the crate, the registry, the wire field, and
tasks T-911…T-917. It was V1 item 8; §4.3 of the spec now says what replaced it,
which is a status somebody typed. Do not build it back — that is Matt's call, not
a maintenance decision.

**M4.5 was added on 2026-08-21**, after the client turned out to have no way to create
a room, invite anybody, or edit the server — every endpoint for all three has existed
since M1 with nobody calling it. It also carries the server list from §3 of the spec
(V1 item 17), which had never been given a task at all.

M7 is not interesting and cannot be skipped. macOS notarization in particular is a
tedious, version-sensitive slog. Budget the full estimate.
