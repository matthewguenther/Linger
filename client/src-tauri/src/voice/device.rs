//! The microphone and the speakers, through `cpal` (SPEC §4.14, ARCHITECTURE
//! §2, T-1402).
//!
//! This is the file `audio.rs` said would arrive: the two ends of the seam,
//! filled. [`Microphone`] is an `audio::Source` that produces one 20 ms frame
//! at a time from the default input device, and [`Speaker`] is an
//! `audio::Sink` that mixes every peer's frames into the default output
//! device. Nothing else in the voice path knows a device exists.
//!
//! **Two things live here that AGENTS §"Where you will be wrong" names, and
//! both are handled in the smallest way that is not wrong:**
//!
//! - **Sample rate.** Everything past this file is 48 kHz mono. A device that
//!   will not do 48 kHz gets its native rate and a linear resampler at the
//!   edge — good enough for a voice, and confined to one struct so T-1405 can
//!   replace it without touching anything else.
//! - **Hotplug and the default device changing** (T-1405). A device that
//!   disappears kills its stream, and the stream's error callback rings an
//!   alarm the worker thread is waiting on. The worker drops the dead stream
//!   and opens the device again — the *default* device, if that is what was
//!   asked for, which is how "the OS switched to the headphones" becomes
//!   "audio continues on the headphones". It tries every half second for
//!   about twenty seconds and then gives up honestly: the microphone ends its
//!   source (the engine says `stopped`), the speaker goes quiet. Nothing in
//!   here can tell a device that was unplugged from one that went away for
//!   good, so the timeout is the whole of that decision.
//!
//! **Threads.** A `cpal` stream is driven by a thread the library owns, and
//! the stream handle itself is not something to hand between threads. So each
//! device gets one worker thread of ours that opens the device, starts the
//! stream, and then sleeps until told to stop — dropping the stream on the
//! same thread that built it. The callbacks talk to the rest of the world
//! through channels and one mutex, and never block.
