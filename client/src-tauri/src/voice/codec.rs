//! Opus, in both directions (SPEC §4.14, T-1402).
//!
//! WebRTC audio *is* Opus: it is the one codec every implementation must
//! carry, and the one `voice::Engine` negotiates. There is no mature pure-Rust
//! encoder, so this wraps libopus — built from the vendored source by the
//! `opus` crate (which is why `cmake` is on the build box list), so a shipped
//! binary carries its own copy and nobody's machine needs a system libopus.
//!
//! One frame in is one packet out, and one packet in is one frame out. The
//! frame is `audio::FRAME_SAMPLES` of mono at `audio::SAMPLE_RATE`, which is
//! also what the RTP payload format for Opus (RFC 7587) puts in one packet, so
//! nothing here has to split or join anything.
