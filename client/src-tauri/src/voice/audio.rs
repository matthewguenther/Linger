//! The two ends of the audio path: where sound comes from, and where it goes
//! (SPEC §4.14, ARCHITECTURE §2, T-1402).
//!
//! This is the seam between the engine and the hardware. The real ends are in
//! `device.rs` — a `cpal` microphone and a `cpal` speaker — and the ones here
//! are the stand-ins the tests use: silence, a tone, and a sink that drops
//! everything. The engine cannot tell them apart, which is the point.
//!
//! The seam is one 20 ms frame in each direction, which is not an invented
//! boundary: it is the frame size Opus and WebRTC both work in, so the
//! microphone fills the same buffer the encoder reads and nothing in between
//! has to think about it.
//!
//! Two things are deliberately *not* here:
//!
//! - **Device selection** is T-1405's, along with hotplug and the OS default
//!   changing under a call. Today the default device is the device.
//! - **Mixing several peers** happens on the playback side, inside the sink.
//!   [`Sink::play`] takes the peer it came from so the sink can keep one lane
//!   per person and sum them at the last moment.
