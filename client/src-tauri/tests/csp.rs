//! The two Content-Security-Policies, checked against the config that ships.
//!
//! `tauri.conf.json` carries two policies, and which one the WebView gets is
//! decided at compile time by Tauri's own `is_dev()`: `devCsp` under
//! `pnpm tauri dev`, `csp` in anything the bundler produces. The split exists
//! because development talks to a server on `http://localhost:8080` and a
//! shipped copy has no business talking to a random port on the machine it
//! landed on — a page that can reach `http://localhost:*` can knock on every
//! service the person is running.
//!
//! Two sources look like a relaxation and are not. `ipc:` and
//! `http://ipc.localhost` are Tauri's own IPC channel — `invoke()` is a `fetch`
//! at one of those two URLs, the first on Linux and macOS and the second on
//! Windows. Blocking them does not stop IPC, it silently drops it onto a slower
//! `postMessage` fallback, which is a worse failure than a loud one.
//!
//! These are assertions about a JSON file rather than about a running WebView,
//! and that is the honest limit of them: they prove the shipped policy says
//! what it is meant to say. Whether a real installed build still reaches a real
//! server is M7's milestone check, and a person has to watch that happen.
