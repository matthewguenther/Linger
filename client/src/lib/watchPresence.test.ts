/**
 * The presence driver's one job: when something changes, a frame goes out.
 *
 * `presence.test.ts` covers the deciding. This covers the part around it — the
 * guard that stops two passes running at once — because that guard had a bug
 * that no test of `decide` could ever have caught: the frames simply stopped,
 * quietly, and the last ones sent stayed true on the server.
 *
 * Since T-412 it also covers the other thing this file can get quietly wrong:
 * two servers sharing one window, where being in a room on one has to mean
 * being in no room on the other.
