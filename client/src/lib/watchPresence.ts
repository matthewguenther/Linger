/**
 * Watch the window, send `room.focus`, `idle` and `away`.
 *
 * The clocks and the deciding live in `presence.ts`. This file is the part
 * that cannot be tested without a window: it listens for input and focus,
 * holds the last thing we sent, and talks to the gateway.
 *
 * There is one window and there can be several servers (T-412), so the two
 * halves are split. Focus and the last keystroke are global — they are facts
 * about the person, not about a connection. Everything that was last *said* to
 * a server is per server, in a `Watch`, because each connection has its own
 * presence map and forgets it on every reconnect.
 *
 * You are in at most one room anywhere, so `setPresenceRoom` puts you in a room
 * on one server and takes you out of the room on all the others. Switching
 * servers in the rail is what that is for: the room you left stops showing you
 * standing in it.
