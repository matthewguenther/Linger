/**
 * The gateway store: the frontend's one piece of shared state.
 *
 * AGENTS allows local component state plus exactly one gateway store, and this
 * is it — subscribe-and-notify instead of a state library. React reads it
 * through `useSyncExternalStore`, so every component that cares re-renders on a
 * change and nothing else does.
 *
 * The connection itself is not here. It lives in the Tauri core
 * (ARCHITECTURE §1), which owns reconnecting, resume and sequence numbers and
 * sends two events up: a connection status, and each sequenced server frame.
 * This file folds those frames into a snapshot the UI can render, answers when
 * the core says it needs a fresh access token, and holds each open room's
 * history — because history arrives two ways, as pages over REST and as frames
 * over the socket, and the two have to be stitched together in one place.
 *
 * **One snapshot per server, keyed by base URL (T-412).** The client can be
 * signed into several servers at once, and each one has its own rooms, its own
 * people and its own read markers. Nothing is shared between them: a room id
 * only means anything next to the server it came from. The core tags every
 * event it sends up with the server it belongs to, and every function here
 * either takes that server's `AuthedApi` or the base URL itself.
 *
 * Running `pnpm dev` in a plain browser, with no Tauri underneath, leaves the
 * status on `offline` — the same honest degrading as session storage.
