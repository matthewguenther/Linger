 * Since T-412 this is a list: one stored session per server, keyed by base URL.
 * Saving one replaces only that server's entry, and forgetting one leaves the
 * rest signed in.

 * Running `pnpm dev` in a plain browser (no Tauri) is a supported way to work on
 * the UI, and it behaves exactly like a computer with no keyring: nothing is
 * remembered, and the app says so.
