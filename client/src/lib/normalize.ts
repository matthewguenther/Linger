/**
 * "Normalize everyone" (SPEC §4.5, constraint 5).
 *
 * Some people will want the room quiet — every name in the reader's own default
 * style, no gradients, no shimmer, no characterful faces, and message fonts
 * flattened with them. Give it to them without friction.
 *
 * This is the reader's preference about their own screen, not something anyone
 * else can see, so it lives here and in local storage rather than in the gateway
 * store — the same shape `density.ts` uses, and for the same reason. The whole
 * of the effect is one attribute on `<html>`: `styles/names.css` has rules that
 * outrank every per-person value, so nothing that draws a name has to know this
 * switch exists.
