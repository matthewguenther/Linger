/**
 * The clock the UI reads.
 *
 * Anything that says "40m" or fades with age has to be recomputed as time
 * passes, and a component that owns its own timer is a component that ticks on
 * its own schedule — two of them side by side disagree by up to a minute. One
 * hook, one interval per subscriber, everything derived from the number it
 * hands back.
 *
 * Note this returns a moment, never a duration. Callers take `now` as an
 * argument so the arithmetic stays pure and testable (`stream/time.ts`,
 * `roster/roster.ts`).
