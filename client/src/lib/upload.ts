/**
 * Putting a file on the server (PROTOCOL §6, ARCHITECTURE §8).
 *
 * Three steps and no bytes through the API: ask for a slot, PUT the bytes
 * straight at the URL that comes back, then say it is finished. A file over
 * 8 MB comes back with one signed URL per part, and that is the whole of what
 * makes an upload resumable — a part that fails is a part, not a file.
 *
 * So this retries a part rather than an upload, and if `complete` says parts are
 * missing it sends those parts again and asks once more. That refusal is the
 * ordinary shape of a dropped connection and leaves the slot alive; every other
 * refusal is final and is thrown at the caller (PROTOCOL §6).
