/**
 * The one-line cards links render as (SPEC §5.6).
 *
 * A card holds a favicon, a title and a domain, and every one of those comes
 * from the server — **the client never fetches a preview and never points an
 * `<img>` at a linked site**. If it did, scrolling past a message would tell
 * that site who read it, which is exactly the thing this product is for not
 * doing. The favicon arrives inline as a `data:` URI, so drawing a card makes
 * no request at all (PROTOCOL §6).
 *
 * What lives here is the asking: a small per-server cache, and one round trip
 * for however many links came on screen together rather than one each. Rows
 * mount and unmount constantly in a virtualized list, so a URL is asked about
 * once and remembered, including when the answer was "nothing" — a card with
 * just its domain is a finished card, not a retry.
