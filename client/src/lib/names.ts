/**
 * The name rendering engine (SPEC §4.5) — how a person is drawn, wherever they
 * are drawn.
 *
 * AIM had no profile pictures; it had decorated names, and people put real work
 * into them. Everything a person controls about their own name — face, weight,
 * slant, one palette color or a gradient of two, and an effect — arrives here as
 * a `Style` off the wire and leaves as custom properties plus two data
 * attributes. Nothing in this file knows what "azure" looks like: the colors are
 * `--name-*` variables generated from `linger-core::PALETTE` into
 * `generated/palette.generated.css`, which is the only place in the codebase a
 * key becomes a color (AGENTS rule 12).
 *
 * The split is deliberate:
 *
 * - [`personStyle`] goes on a *container* — a stream row, a roster card, a
 *   popover. It sets the custom properties, so the 3px gutter rule beside
 *   somebody's messages and their message font come from the same place their
 *   name does and cannot drift apart.
 * - [`nameProps`] goes on the *name itself*. It re-states the same properties
 *   (harmless, and it means a name works with no styled ancestor at all) and
 *   adds the class and the attributes `styles/names.css` paints from.
 *
 * The painting is CSS, not React, for one reason: "normalize everyone"
 * (SPEC §4.5, constraint 5) has to flatten every name in the app at once, and a
 * reader-side switch that has to reach every component is a switch that will one
 * day miss one. It is an attribute on `<html>` and a handful of rules that
 * outrank these values, and it cannot miss anything.
