/**
 * Being in a room, and the two clocks that take you out of it.
 *
 * SPEC §4.1: focusing the app on a room means you are in the room. Other
 * people see this. Backgrounding the app, or sitting still for 90 seconds,
 * takes you out. SPEC §4.3: no input for ten minutes is `idle`.
 *
 * Pure, and takes the clock as arguments, so the 90-second and ten-minute
 * edges can be tested without waiting for either. The driver that reads the
 * window and sends the frames is `watchPresence.ts`.
 *
 * `away` is a deliberate state a person chooses, not a clock running out, so
 * it comes in from outside as `wantAway` and outranks everything here: while
 * it is set the two clocks stop mattering, because somebody who said they are
 * away does not stop being away by sitting still.
