/**
 * Dark, light, and the warmth that arrives after sunset (SPEC §4.7, §5.3).
 *
 * Two preferences, both the reader's own and neither of them anybody else's
 * business, so they live here and in local storage the way density does. Both
 * are one attribute on `<html>` and a block of custom properties in
 * `styles/tokens.css` — no second stylesheet, and nothing that draws anything
 * knows which theme it is in.
 *
 * **About "sunset".** The spec says the shift happens after local sunset, and
 * the honest way to know that is a latitude and a longitude. This app does not
 * ask for those and is not going to: a chat client that wants your coordinates
 * to tint its background has made a bad trade. So sunset is approximated by the
 * clock — warm in the evening, cool again in the morning, on the reader's own
 * local time. It is wrong by up to a couple of hours in June and December at
 * high latitudes, and the whole effect is a 200K tint that most people will
 * never consciously notice, which is the reason that is an acceptable trade and
 * a location permission is not.
