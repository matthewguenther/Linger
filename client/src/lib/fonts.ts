/**
 * The twelve curated faces, as CSS variable names.
 *
 * `linger-core::FONTS` is the one definition of the set (SPEC §5.7) and the
 * server rejects any `font_key` that is not in it, because client-side
 * validation alone is a defect (AGENTS rule 8). This list is a mirror for the
 * same reason `palette.ts` mirrors the palette keys: the pickers need something
 * to iterate over, and a key this build has never heard of still falls back to
 * the UI face rather than reaching for a font nobody bundled.
 *
 * What each key *looks like* is a client concern — the same way the glyph for a
 * reaction key is — so the family stacks live in `styles/tokens.css` as
 * `--font-<key>`. T-604 fetches, subsets and `@font-face`s the actual files; a
 * key whose face is not installed falls through its stack to the generic at the
 * end, which is why a name is never invisible while that task is open.
