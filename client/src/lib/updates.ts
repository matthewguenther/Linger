/**
 * The Tauri side of in-app updates (T-701).
 *
 * These types mirror `src-tauri/src/updates.rs` by hand, the same way
 * `ipc.ts` mirrors `secrets.rs`: AGENTS rule 7 covers types crossing the
 * *wire*, and none of these ever leave the machine. A Rust test pins the
 * `kind` spellings so the two halves can't drift silently.
 *
 * The page never talks to the updater plugin. It calls two of the app's own
 * commands, and the capability file grants the plugin nothing — a WebView that
 * could download and run an installer is not a WebView with a minimum
 * permission set (ARCHITECTURE §7.7).
 *
 * `pnpm dev` in a plain browser has no shell to ask, so everything here reports
 * `unconfigured`, which is also what a build with no signing key reports. Both
 * mean the same thing to a reader: this copy cannot update itself.
