/**
 * The search surface (SPEC §4.12, T-1203).
 *
 * A destination in the rail, next to `media`, opening in place of the message
 * stream — the same pattern the media collection uses, and for the same reason:
 * a place that is not a room is still a place, and nothing in this product
 * floats over the conversation. `Ctrl`/`Cmd`+`K` is a shortcut *into* here with
 * the box focused, never a second surface with its own behavior.
 *
 * What the spec refuses is most of what a search box usually does. No relevance
 * ranking — results are newest first and there is no control to change that.
 * No history, no saved searches, no suggestions: nothing about a search is
 * written down on either side, which is why there is no state in this file that
 * outlives the panel. And no query language, so what is typed goes to the
 * server as typed and the server looks for the words in it.
 *
 * A hit is a line: who, which room, when, and a few words either side of the
 * match with the matched words marked. Clicking one opens that room and goes to
 * that message, which is where the real message gets fetched — a hit is
 * deliberately not a `Message` (PROTOCOL §6).

 * One hit: who, where, when, and a few words with the match marked.

 * The whole line is the way to the message, the way a media tile is the way to

 * matched ones get `<mark>` — there is nothing to parse and nothing to escape,
 * which is exactly why the server sends runs instead of a marked-up string
 * (PROTOCOL §6).
 *
 * The filename line only appears when the message text did not carry the match,
 * because that is the case where a hit otherwise looks like a mistake: the
 * words are not in the words, they are in what the file was called.
 *
 * A hit from an archived room is drawn and cannot be opened. The index covers
 * every message that has not been deleted, archived room or not — which is
 * right, because archiving a room is not deleting what was said in it — but
 * the client has nowhere to take you: an archived room is not in the rail and
 * has no stream to scroll. Saying so is better than a click that silently
