 * that is not one of them. The glyph and the wording for each are the client's
 * business, which is why they live here and not on the wire.
 *
 * **Reactions accumulate by weight, never by number.** Six people hitting the
 * same reaction make a bigger, denser mark, not `👍 6`. The count exists — it
 * comes down the wire and it goes into the hover text and the accessible label,
 * where a person who asks for it gets a straight answer — but it is never drawn
 * as a numeral. Numbers invite comparison; weight carries the same information
 * without asking anybody to count.
