 * Messages in, rows out.

 * The stream is not a list of messages — it is a list of *rows*, because a

 * component down to "draw row N" and keeps the virtualizer's job simple: every
 * row has a stable key, so a row that was already measured stays measured when
 * older history is prepended above it.
