/**
 * Drawing a parsed message body.
 *
 * Every node kind in `markdown.ts` gets exactly one element here, and text goes
 * in as a React child, which means React escapes it. That is the allowlist
 * ARCHITECTURE §7 asks for, expressed as a `switch` the compiler checks rather
 * than as a list of tags to strip: there is no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in the
 * client, so there is no way for a message body to become markup in the first
 * place. `<img onerror=alert(1)>` in a message is fourteen characters on
 * screen.
 *
 * Mono type appears here for code, and only for code. SPEC §5.2 lists code as
 * one of mono's roles alongside timestamps and numerals; prose in a message
 * body stays sans, which is the rule AGENTS 11 is protecting.
