/**
 * The message stream: the room you are looking at.
 *
 * Four things here are load-bearing.
 *
 * **It is virtualized from day one** (AGENTS). Ten thousand messages is one
 * evening in a room that gets used, and a list that renders all of them is a
 * list that has to be rewritten later. Only the rows on screen exist in the
 * DOM; every row has a stable key, so a row that was already measured stays
 * measured when older history is prepended above it.
 *
 * **The stream hangs from the bottom.** New messages push the view along when
 * you are already at the end, and history loading in above you must not move
 * what you are reading. Both are the virtualizer's `anchorTo: "end"`.
 *
 * **Nothing renders as HTML.** Message bodies are parsed into a tree of known
 * node kinds and drawn as React elements (`markdown.ts`, `Markdown.tsx`), so a
 * body that looks like markup is text that looks like markup.
 *
 * **Reactions are weight, never numbers** (SPEC §4.8). The count comes down the
 * wire and goes into the hover text and the accessible label; it is never drawn
 * as a numeral.
 *
 * **Nothing here counts anything** (SPEC §4.2). Where you left off is a line in
 * the stream, not a number beside a room name, and "since you were gone" is
 * something you pull from the header rather than something that arrives.
