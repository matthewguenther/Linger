/**
 * Getting the whole server out of it (SPEC §4.11, T-802).
 *
 * The server does the work; this is the part that asks, waits, and says what is
 * happening in words. Three things it deliberately does:
 *
 * - **Polls, rather than listening.** There is no gateway frame for export
 *   progress and there should not be one — a job belongs to the one person who
 *   asked for it, and putting it on a socket every member shares would tell
 *   everybody when anybody takes a copy.
 * - **Says when to come back.** A second export inside the hour is a
 *   `RATE_LIMITED` refusal carrying `retry_after_ms`. That is a sentence, not
 *   an error: "you can ask again in about 50 minutes".
 * - **Hands the finished file to the system browser.** The WebView never
 *   navigates itself to a zip — same rule as a link in a message
 *   (`lib/external.ts`): a window that follows a download has left the app.
