/**
 * The arithmetic behind the style picker (SPEC §4.5) — the parts that can be
 * wrong without looking wrong.
 *
 * A `Style` off the wire is a flat record and the picker is a set of small
 * choices, so this is the translation between them, plus the two questions the
 * form asks constantly: is anything different from what is saved, and what
 * exactly do we send.
 *
 * The server validates every key against `linger-core::PALETTE` and
 * `linger-core::FONTS` (AGENTS rule 8), and it is the authority. The checks
 * here exist so the form can refuse a no-op before the round trip and so a key
 * this build has never heard of falls back to something drawable — not so the
 * client can second-guess the server.
