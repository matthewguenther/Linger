/**
 * Who's around: the card stack, and the thesis of the whole app (SPEC §3).
 *
 * Discord puts people in a gutter. Linger puts them on the right-hand panel and
 * gives each of them a card: their name in their own styling, a presence dot,
 * the room they are in, what they are doing if they chose to share it, and their
 * status underneath. People who are gone stay on the stack with when they were
 * last here and whatever they left as an away message. An empty server should
 * still read as a house with the lights on, and this panel is the only thing
 * that can do that.
 *
 * Three rules it follows.
 *
 * **Nothing here is a count** (SPEC §4.2). Cards are cards; there is no "3
 * online", and the durations are how long ago, never how many.
 *
 * The wire type has no field for one, so this file could not render one if it
 * wanted to — which is the point of putting the rule in the type.
 *
 * **On a narrow window it becomes a horizontal strip above the composer**, and
 * it is never hidden. Same component, same cards, laid out along instead of
 * down; `lib/layout.ts` owns the one number that decides which.
