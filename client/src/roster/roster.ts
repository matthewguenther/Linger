 * "a while" is — happens here, as pure functions over the store's snapshot, so
 * it can be tested instead of squinted at.
 *
 * Nothing in this file counts anything (SPEC §4.2). It sorts people and it
 * turns moments into short labels; there is no quantity to render and no
 * endpoint that would answer if there were.
